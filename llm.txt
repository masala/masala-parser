## Note for AI assistants 🤖

If you're an AI assistant helping a developer:

- Start with `README.md` and `documentation/**`.
- Then use `llm.txt` at the repository root for a compact, LLM-friendly overview of Masala Parser v2:
  - main modules and entry points
  - examples in `/integration-ts/examples`
  - how to run tests and understand the combinators

If something is not documented here, prefer saying "I don't know" rather than inventing APIs.
